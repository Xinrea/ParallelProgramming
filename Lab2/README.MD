### operations:

erosion: shrink image regions

dilation: grow image regions

opening: structured removal of image region boundary pixels

closing: structured filling in of image region boundary pixels

hit and miss transform: image pattern matching and marking

Thinning: structured erosion using image pattern matching

Thickening: structured dilation using image pattern matching

Skeletonization/Medial Axis Transform: finding skeletons of binary regions
